### RCP

https://www.rcolepeterson.com/

I lead highly collaborative teams to create world-class digital products and experiences. Working closely with designers, product managers, strategists, and developers, I concept, prototype, and execute on a range of projectsâ€”from experiments and prototypes for pitches to full-scale production apps for clients.

I specialize in building web apps with cutting-edge technologies, along with various AI frameworks and solutions. I develop generative user interfaces and chatbots through prompt engineering, and leverage AI to create more dynamic and engaging user experiences.

My passion lies in creating scalable applications using JavaScript on both the client and server, with a focus on writing modular, reusable, testable, and performant code.
